Here's how to start using `Task - the Todo app for CLI`!

- Go ahead and make sure you have Node.js installed in your machine first.
- Extract the zip file
- Install all dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

- Next enter the following command to make the package available globally in your machine

```bash
npm link
```

- Next `cd` into the root folder of the project ( which contains all the files - readme.md, task.js, etc)
- Run `task report` to initialise the package.
- After this you can start using the CLI tool from anywhere in the command line. ( try `cd ~`)
- Go ahead and start using the CLI tool by adding `task` before every command.

## Usage/Examples

```bash
$ task add 2 hello world    # Add a new item with priority 2 and text "hello world" to the list
$ task ls                   # Show incomplete priority list items sorted by priority in ascending order
$ task del INDEX            # Delete the incomplete item with the given index
$ task done INDEX           # Mark the incomplete item with the given index as complete
$ task help                 # Show usage
$ task report               # Statistics
```

That's pretty much it!
